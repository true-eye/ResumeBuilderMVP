      Hiring managers will scan this information looking for career progression, i.e.- how long
      you've stayed in each job, your growth and promotions, whether you've worked for similar
      companies and whether you have gaps in employment.

    <ul className='list-tips'>
      <li>
        Enter basic information about your previous jobs so employers can see where you've worked.
      </li>
      <li>
        Don't abbreviate job titles. Using your full title looks more professional and is easier for
        managers to understand.
      </li>
      <li>
        Include start and end dates for each position. Leaving off dates will make employers think
        you're hiding something.
      </li>
      <li>
        Can't remember your exact start date or job title? Don't worry - enter your best guess and
        come back to edit it later, once you've confirmed the information.
